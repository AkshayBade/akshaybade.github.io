- [Local Setup](local-setup)

## What is Kubernetes

- A containers (can be any like Docker managed) archestration tool.
- With rise of microservices & distributed systems, managing all containers has become difficult & K8s helps there.

### How K8s Helps
- Manage scalability in distributed systems
- Manage availability
- Manage disaster recovery etc.


## Local Setup

### Minikube
Make sure docker daemon is running.
- Download linux minikube version
```console
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
```

- Install minikube
```console
# Path can be any executable standard path.
# For Sudo access
sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube

# For Local User access
KUBECONFIG=$HOME/.kube/my_minikube_config
minikube start --memory 8192 --cpus 4
```

#To access the Kubernetes Dashboard, run . to get your dashboard up in background
```console
minikube dashboard &

minikube docker-env
```

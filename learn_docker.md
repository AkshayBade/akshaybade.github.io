## What is Docker
Docker helps you create a package of your application along with its all possible dependencies required to run that application.

## Why to use Docker
This solves problems like,
1. "works on my machine" problems
2. No need to spend redundant efforts of setting up development infra like installing softwares needed to run your application on local along with compatible versions and OS compatibility.
3. Package with all needed configurations
4. Multiple applications can now run in their own containerized environment without conflicting with other applications and their softwares dependencies
5. Makes Deployments faster by removing redundancy of following same installations steps on every environment.

### DNS
- Domain Name System
- All devices conected over internet has its own address called IP Address which is a numeric.
- Remembering numeric address is difficult so it is linked with meaningful name called domain name.
- And a server which stores the mapping of this as a directory is called DNS server.

Look up IP Address for something.com
Browser --> DNS recursive resolver (hosted by Internet Service Provider(ISP) like Jio) --> Root Server --> TLD nameserver (Top Level Domain like .com .edu .gov) -> second-level domain server (name of website, here "something") -- (IP Adress) --> Browser -- (IP Adress) --> something server.
